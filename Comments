1. Home Page 
1.1 first View and 1st block
 Comment
- too much info
- cluttery
- font on the left too Big
- picture holds half the page, but unclear what it is meant to convey. 

Suggestions
- build a Landing Page that floats, something welcoming to "Lets join us on a journey, "Join Button""

1.2 2nd Block 
Comment
- too tight with first block, seems cluttery. 

Suggestion
- add more space between the 1st block and 2nd Block

1.x Last Block
Comment
- shorten the size of the landing page, if possible make it endless scroll, but clear transition between the blocks. looks like a scam site.
